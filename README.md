> Subscription Service App

## about the project
- This is my final project at Tuwaiq iOS programming Bootcamp

### The main feature of the app
#### Scheduled Delivery
- you can view local cafés menus, and Create your own subscription from any café ahead of time.


Room for improvement:
- More flexible subscriptions ( in terms of plan duration, multiple cafes per plan and more )
- Adding alternatives of the selected items ahead of time
